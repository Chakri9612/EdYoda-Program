Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples

Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]


def get_last_element(tuple):   # The get_last_element function takes a tuple as input and returns the last element of that tuple.
    return tuple[-1]  # It uses the indexing operator [-1] to access the last element.

def sort_tuples(tuples):  # The sort_tuples function takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list
    return sorted(tuples, key=get_last_element)   # containing the tuples sorted in increasing order based on their last element.
    # It uses the sorted function with the key parameter set to get_last_element.
    # The key parameter specifies a function that takes an item from the iterable in this case, a tuple and returns a value that will be used for sorting.
 
tuples_list = [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
sorted_list = sort_tuples(tuples_list)
print(sorted_list)


The get_last_element function takes a tuple as input and returns the last element of that tuple. 
It uses the indexing operator [-1] to access the last element. 
This function acts as a helper function to extract the last element from each tuple.
The sort_tuples function takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the tuples sorted in increasing order based on their last element. 
It uses the sorted function with the key parameter set to get_last_element. 
The key parameter specifies a function that takes an item from the iterable (in this case, a tuple) and returns a value that will be used for sorting. 
By passing get_last_element as the key function, the sorting algorithm uses the last element of each tuple as the criterion for sorting.
In the example usage, a list of tuples [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)] is created. 
This list contains tuples with various values. The sort_tuples function is then called, passing this list as the argument. 
The function sorts the list based on the last element of each tuple and returns a new sorted list.
The sorted list is stored in the sorted_list variable. 
Finally, the sorted list is printed using the print function, displaying the tuples sorted in increasing order based on their last element.
